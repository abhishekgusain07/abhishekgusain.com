# Daily Log - Wednesday, January 22, 2025

## What I worked on today

- Implemented a better content loading system for the devlog
- Added more sample log entries to test the listing functionality
- Researched MDX integration options for Next.js App Router
- Started working on proper file system integration

## Deep dive: File system integration

Today I explored how to properly read markdown files from the file system in Next.js. The key insight is using the `fs` module server-side:

```typescript
import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path'

function getLogContent(date: string) {
  const logsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'src/logs')
  const filePath = path.join(logsDirectory, `${date}.mdx`)
  
  if (!fs.existsSync(filePath)) {
    return null
  }
  
  return fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8')
}
```

## UI improvements

I'm really happy with how the design is shaping up. The hover effects on the log entries feel smooth and the color transitions work well with both light and dark themes.

The inspiration design had a nice red accent color, but I think the neutral palette works better for my portfolio's aesthetic.

## Learning moment

One thing I realized today is the importance of having good sample content when building interfaces. It really helps to see how the design holds up with realistic content.

## Performance considerations

Since these are static markdown files, I could potentially pre-generate a lot of this at build time. Something to consider as the number of logs grows.

## Tomorrow's goals

- Integrate MDX properly with syntax highlighting
- Add a way to automatically discover available log files
- Create a better content management workflow
- Maybe add tags or categories to logs
