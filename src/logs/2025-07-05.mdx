# Daily Log - Saturday, July 5, 2025

## What I worked on today

### OneStopMarketing - Slideshow Feature
back to working on the slideshow feature today. this tiktok slideshow thing is turning out to be more complex than i thought but it's coming together.

fixed the image upload flow - users can now either upload their own images or generate them through ai. the ai integration is working pretty well, though sometimes the generated images don't fit the vibe the user wants. might need to add more prompt engineering options.

spent a lot of time on the text overlay system. getting text to position correctly on different image sizes is annoying as hell. ended up using canvas for the text rendering which gives more control but the code is messier.

also polished the slideshow editor UI. added drag and drop for reordering slides, better preview functionality, and some animations to make it feel more responsive.

## tiktok integration headache
started researching tiktok api integration and... fuck. because tiktok is banned in india, i can't even access their developer portal properly. but my target audience isn't indian users so i need to figure out a legal way to do this.

looking into using proxy services or maybe hosting the integration part overseas. this is gonna be a compliance nightmare but tiktok slideshows perform way too well to ignore.

## what's working
- ai image generation -> slideshow pipeline is smooth
- text overlay system (finally)
- drag and drop slide reordering
- preview functionality

## what's not working
- tiktok api access (regional restrictions)
- large image files make the editor laggy
- need better compression for uploaded images

## next steps
gonna work on instagram integration tomorrow. that should be easier since facebook's api is at least accessible, even if their dev experience sucks ass.
