# Daily Log - Monday, January 20, 2025

## What I worked on today

- Started implementing the devlog feature for my portfolio
- Set up the basic directory structure for logs
- Created the main `/logs` listing page with a beautiful design
- Implemented dynamic routing for individual log entries at `/logs/[date]`

## Challenges faced

- Understanding how to properly structure Next.js App Router dynamic routes
- Adapting the design inspiration to match my existing portfolio's color scheme
- Figuring out the right balance between functionality and simplicity for the MVP

## What I learned

The Next.js App Router makes dynamic routing incredibly elegant with its file-based approach. The `[date]` folder automatically creates the dynamic route parameter.

I also learned about generating dynamic metadata using the `generateMetadata` function, which is perfect for SEO-friendly devlog entries.

## Tomorrow's plan

- Add MDX support for rich markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
- Create a few more sample log entries to populate the listing
- Implement proper markdown file reading instead of mock data
- Add better error handling and 404 pages

## Code snippet of the day

```typescript
// Dynamic metadata generation
export async function generateMetadata({ params }: LogPageProps): Promise<Metadata> {
  const { date } = params
  const formattedDate = formatDate(date)
  
  return {
    title: `Devlog - ${formattedDate} - Abhishek Gusain`,
    description: `Daily development log for ${formattedDate}`,
  }
}
```

This pattern allows each log entry to have its own proper meta tags for social sharing and SEO.

## Reflection

It's exciting to have a dedicated space to document my daily engineering journey. This devlog will help me track progress, remember solutions to problems, and share my learning process with others.

The inspiration design I found really captures the essence of what I want - a clean, organized way to browse through daily entries with filtering capabilities.
