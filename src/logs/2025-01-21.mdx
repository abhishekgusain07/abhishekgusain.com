# Daily Log - Tuesday, January 21, 2025

## What I worked on today

- Created additional sample log entries to test the devlog functionality
- Refined the styling of the logs listing page to better match the portfolio theme
- Added proper navigation between log entries
- Started planning the MDX integration for rich markdown rendering

## Challenges faced

- Ensuring the color scheme is consistent across all pages
- Making sure the responsive design works well on mobile devices
- Deciding on the best way to organize and structure the log content

## What I learned

Working with Tailwind's custom color system is really powerful. The neutral color palette provides a great foundation for a clean, professional look.

I'm also appreciating how Next.js App Router handles dynamic routes - it's so much cleaner than the pages router approach.

## Progress update

The basic structure of the devlog is taking shape nicely. The main features working so far:

- âœ… Dynamic routing for individual log entries
- âœ… Clean listing page with hover effects
- âœ… Responsive design that matches the portfolio
- âœ… Proper navigation and breadcrumbs
- ðŸ”„ MDX integration (next up)
- ðŸ”„ Date filtering functionality
- ðŸ”„ Search capabilities

## Code exploration

Today I spent time understanding how the existing portfolio components work. The `ThemeToggle` component is particularly elegant:

```typescript
// Simple but effective theme switching
const ThemeToggle = () => {
  // Implementation details...
}
```

## Tomorrow's plan

- Implement actual MDX file reading instead of mock content
- Add syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Create a utility to scan for all available log files
- Add better typography for the markdown content

## Random thoughts

It's fascinating how documenting the development process makes me more mindful of what I'm learning and building. This meta-aspect of building a tool to document building is quite enjoyable.
