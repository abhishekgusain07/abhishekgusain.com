# Daily Log - Monday, July 7, 2025

## What I worked on today

### OneStopMarketing - UI Polish Day

spent the whole day fixing annoying ui bugs and polishing the slideshow editor. this is the kind of work that's not exciting but makes a huge difference in user experience.

fixed that annoying image display bug in the slideshow picker modal. turns out the issue was with how i was handling image loading states. now images actually show up properly instead of broken placeholders.

updated the color scheme to slate throughout the app. the old colors were inconsistent and looked amateurish. slate gives it a more professional look and better contrast.

added proper loading states everywhere. before this, users would click something and nothing would happen for a few seconds. now there's spinners and progress indicators so at least they know something is happening.

## the small stuff that matters

- fixed text selection styling (was only working on hover, wtf)
- added slide count display so users know how many slides they have
- improved the slideshow delete functionality with proper confirmation modal
- fixed toolbar scrolling issues in the editor
- made everything more mobile responsive

## what i learned today

these small ui improvements make such a huge difference in how the app feels. users don't notice when things work smoothly but they definitely notice when things are broken or janky.

also realized i need to be more systematic about testing on different screen sizes. half the bugs i fixed today were mobile-specific issues that i never caught because i always test on desktop.

## tomorrow's plan

back to instagram integration. the ui polish was necessary but now i need to get the core functionality working.

## side note

why do i always underestimate how long ui polish takes? it's never "just a quick fix" - there's always 10 other things that need to be updated once you start touching the styling.
