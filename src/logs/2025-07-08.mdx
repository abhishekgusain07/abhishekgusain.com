# Daily Log - Tuesday, July 8, 2025

## What I worked on today

Honestly, I was seriously ill today and couldn't do anything productive. Spent most of the day resting and trying to recover.

## Random thoughts

Thought about buying Claude Code to help with my coding tasks. Decided I'll go ahead and purchase it tomorrow when I'm feeling a bit better.

## Learning

Managed to learn a little bit about data engineering, even though I wasn't feeling well. Just some basics, but it's a start.
